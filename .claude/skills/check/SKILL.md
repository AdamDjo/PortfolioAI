Run quality checks on the monorepo. Execute these commands sequentially and report results:

1. Run TypeScript type-check:

```bash
pnpm type-check
```

2. If type-check passes, run lint:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

3. Report results clearly:

- If all pass: confirm everything is clean
- If errors: list each error with file path and line number, then suggest fixes
