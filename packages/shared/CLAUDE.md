# Shared Package Agent Instructions

## Scope

This agent works ONLY on `packages/shared/`. Never modify files outside this directory.

## Purpose

Single source of truth for all TypeScript types and constants shared between frontend and backend. Published as `@portfolio/shared`.

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── types/              # All TypeScript interfaces & types
│   ├── api.types.ts    # Generic API response types (always keep)
│   └── ...             # Add your domain types here
└── index.ts            # Barrel export (re-exports everything)
```

## Rules

- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for values, `camelCase` for helper functions
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Named exports only
- ZERO runtime dependencies — types and constants only
- Always update `index.ts` when adding new exports
- Any type used by both frontend AND backend must live here
- Never import from `apps/frontend` or `apps/backend`

## When to Modify

- Before implementing a new feature in backend/frontend, define types here first
- When a backend/frontend change requires a shared contract change

## Testing

- Run `pnpm type-check --filter shared` to verify types compile
